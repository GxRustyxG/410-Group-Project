# 410-Group-Project
This is a repository for all the data, python files, as well as any random files needed for this project. This is a public repo so that everyone in the project group can view its contents


How to use the Edited Python Files folder contents. So the files that are here are all files that at the minimum required in order to have it run. 
I'll will also assume that everyone here will be using Pycharm as thats how I got this to work, otherwise you will be mostly on your own.

1. First, make sure that you have any versions between Python 7 - 10. If you dont have any installed, go to pythons website and check downloads. I downloaded the Python 3.10.10 update that released on Fed 8th if you wanted the specifics.

2. After making sure that you have a compatible Python version installed (specific version was for a package accessability), create a new project.

3. The main files you will need to download is 'stock_data', 'stock_app', 'NSE-Tata-Global-Beverages-Limited', as well as 'main'. However, if you want you can just look at the content within 'main' and just copy paste that into your own generated 'main' file. All files should be within the project as to keep file path searching easier.

4. With all the files installed, run 'main'. This *should* create a file called 'saved_lstm_model.h5' into your files where everything else already is. If it ran properly, it should of closed without an error.

5. Now, change your run file button from 'main' to 'stock_app'. When you run this, you might get an error about something being unoptimized, ignore that for now. It should eventually print in console a local url link that you can click on and open up the data for viewing. EZ
